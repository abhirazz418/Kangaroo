# Kangaroo
The first kangaroo starts at location 'x1' and moves at a rate of 'v1' meters per jump. The second kangaroo starts at location 'x2' and moves at a rate of 'v2' meters per jump.  You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location at the same time as part of the show. If it is possible, return YES, otherwise return NO.
